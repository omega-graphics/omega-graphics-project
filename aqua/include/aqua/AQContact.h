// AQUA Phase 3 — contact manifold + constraint row PODs and the per-space
// material-combine policy. AQUA-owned, AQ-prefixed (no namespace, per
// AGENTS.md). Every public surface type here is trivially-copyable / standard-
// layout so the row buffer uploads to a GPU constraint-solver kernel with no
// repacking — the Phase 5 SoA port reads `AQConstraintRow` records coalesced,
// one thread per row (Phase-3 brief §7, §8). All vector members default to a
// zero vector via OmegaGTE's `Create()` factory because `OmegaGTE::Matrix`
// keeps its default constructor private (the Phase-1 idiom AQBodyState /
// AQDebugLine / AQAABB use).
//
// Reading order: AQContactPoint is the smallest grain (one point on a shared
// normal); AQContactManifold groups 1..4 of them under that shared normal +
// combined materials; AQConstraintRow is what the PGS sweep actually reads
// (one normal row + two friction rows per contact point, per §6.D / §8).
