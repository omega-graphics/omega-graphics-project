# Agents Code

## Constraints

- Code is roughly inspired by Unreal Engine, and Unity.
   You may reuse old concepts, but make sure not to duplicate code that already exists in either Engine.
   AQUA uses the simplicity of Unity coding, but has complexity and 3D capability as Unreal.
- Code styling is based off of LLVM, and Google.
- All code must be modular and files must use PascalCase with a the prefix: AQUA<name>
- OmegaGTE is the underlying graphics engine.
- OmegaWTK powers the editor
