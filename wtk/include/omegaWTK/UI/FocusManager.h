 §2.3a (Focus, F2): the per-window virtual focus manager.

 There is exactly one OS focus per window (the root NativeItem is the
 first responder when the window is key). Per-view keyboard focus is a
 purely virtual concept: this class is the single authority that tracks
 *which* `View` in a `WidgetTreeHost`'s tree currently owns keyboard
 focus, and why it last changed (see `FocusReason` in `View.h`, which
 gates focus-ring rendering).

 One `FocusManager` is owned by each `WidgetTreeHost` (constructed in the
 host ctor, reached via `WidgetTreeHost::focusManager()`), mirroring the
 host's ownership of `OverlayHost`. The Native-API-Completion-Proposal
 §2.3a Focus "implementation order" table landed this as F2 — a skeleton
 of `setFocus` / `focusedView` / `lastFocusReason` / `clearFocus`. F4
 adds pre-order tree traversal (`focusNext` / `focusPrevious`, driven by
 Tab / Shift-Tab interception in `WidgetTreeHost::dispatchInputEvent`). F5
 adds the restoration stack (`pushRestorationPoint` / `popAndRestore`) for
 Modal / Popover / ContextMenu dismiss. F6 adds `setTabOrder`, the
 Qt-style override that relocates a view to immediately follow another in
 traversal. The Focus block (steps 1–6 + mouse-click focus) is complete.

     @brief The single keyboard-focus authority for one `WidgetTreeHost`.

     Tracks the currently focused `View` and the `FocusReason` that
     selected it. The manager does not own the views it points at — the
     widget tree does — so a `View` that is destroyed or detached while
     focused leaves a dangling `currentlyFocused_`; callers that tear
     down a focused view must `clearFocus()` (or `setFocus(other)`) as
     part of that teardown. (F5's restoration stack is tolerant of
     detached views; the bare F2 pointer is not, by design — adding a
     tree-membership check on every access would duplicate the hit-test
     walk for no F2 consumer.)

        /**
         @brief Make `view` the focused view.

         If `view` already holds focus, only the recorded `FocusReason`
         is refreshed and no focus events are emitted (avoids event
         churn when, e.g., a click re-focuses the already-focused view).

         Otherwise the previously focused view (if any) has its focused
         flag cleared, `view` is marked focused with `reason`, and two
         events fire through the existing `NativeEventEmitter` machinery
         (§2.1): `NativeEvent::FocusGained` on `view` carrying the
         previous `View *` as its params, then `NativeEvent::FocusLost`
         on the previous view carrying the new `View *` as its params.
         The focus flags are written *before* either event is emitted so
         a handler observing `View::isFocused()` sees the settled state.

         The params are passed as the event's raw `void *` (a non-owned
         `View *`); `NativeEvent`'s destructor intentionally does not free
         them for these two event types, so no allocation or leak is
         involved. Pass `nullptr` for `view` to clear focus (equivalent
         to `clearFocus()`, but without the early-out guard).

         @note F2 does not gate on `View::focusPolicy()`. This is the
         low-level primitive; the policy checks live at the call sites
         (mouse-click focus in M1 filters on `ClickFocus`, Tab traversal
         in F4 on `TabFocus`).
