# Native Theme Application Plan

**Status:** Proposal. Nothing below is implemented yet.
**Scope:** Close the cross-platform asymmetry where a `UIView` with no
explicit background color sometimes inherits the underlying OS window's
themed surface color and sometimes renders pitch black. Define the
priority chain that lets app code register a **custom theme** (with
light/dark variants) that overrides the native theme entirely, while
still consulting the OS for the active appearance bit.
**Prerequisite reading:** [Native-API-Completion-Proposal.md](Native-API-Completion-Proposal.md) §2.5
(the existing `NativeTheme.h` query API),
[Style-StyleSheet-Refactor-Plan.md](Style-StyleSheet-Refactor-Plan.md) §3.8
(theme variables on `Application`).
**Non-goals:** Defining the `Theme` data model itself (the Style plan
owns it). Re-specifying `ThemeDesc` (already done in `NativeTheme.h`).
Theming individual widget visuals (UA stylesheet, Style plan Tier 3).
Defining the `ColorScheme` / accent-color semantics beyond what
`ThemeDesc::Colors` already carries.

---

## 1. The asymmetry today

When an `AppWindow` displays a virtual view tree whose root `UIView` has
no explicit background color, what the user sees depends on the
platform:

| Platform | What backs the cleared content area | Themed by OS? |
|----------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| macOS | The native `NSWindow` background paints behind the Metal `CAMetalLayer`. `CAMetalLayer.opaque = NO` lets the window color show through where Metal hasn't drawn. | **Yes — automatically.** |
| Windows | The D3D12 swapchain clears to whatever color the compositor was told. There is no `NSWindow`-like backing surface behind it. | **No.** The window paints whatever clear-color the engine picks; the OS theme never propagates. |
| GTK + Vulkan | `GtkWindow` paints its theme-coloured background to its `GdkWindow` — but the Vulkan swapchain owns the surface pixels once `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` returns, and the swapchain image is whatever `clearValue` we picked. GTK's painted background is never visible inside the rendered region. | **No.** GTK's theme is queried by widgets; the rendered surface is whatever Vulkan clears to (currently pitch black). |

The result is a visible cross-platform inconsistency. The same WTK app:
on macOS, a `UIView` with no background inherits the OS surface color
(white in light mode, dark in dark mode). On Windows it sits on a black
clear. On Linux it sits on a black clear *under a* themed GTK window
frame — making the seam between window chrome and content even more
jarring.

The `NativeTheme` query API (`queryCurrentTheme()` returning a
`ThemeDesc` with `Colors::background`) already exists on macOS and
Win32; GTK's is the gap noted in the Native-API proposal Current State
table. But the API is currently *informational* — nothing reads
`ThemeDesc::Colors::background` and pushes it into the render path's
clear color. macOS works by accident-of-architecture (the native
backing surface), not because anybody chose to apply the theme.

---

## 2. Goal

A single rule that holds on every platform:

> A window with no app-specified background color clears to a defined
> "surface" color. By default that surface color is `NativeTheme.colors.background`
> (so the rendered region matches the OS chrome). If the application
> registers a **custom `Theme`**, the custom theme's surface color is
> used instead — but the active **`ThemeAppearance`** (Light or Dark)
> is still consulted from the OS so the custom theme can pick its own
> light/dark variant.

This means:
- macOS keeps its current visual outcome but reaches it through the same
  code path as the other platforms (explicit `setClearColor`, not
  accidentally-transparent layer compositing).
- Windows: the swapchain clear is the native theme background instead
  of pitch black.
- GTK + Vulkan: same — the Vulkan clear is the native theme background.
- Dark-mode OS systems get a dark cleared surface on all three
  platforms without app code.
- Apps with their own theme system get a single `Application::setTheme(theme)`
  call that overrides the native color but inherits the native
  appearance bit so the theme picks Light or Dark in step with the OS.

---

## 3. Priority chain

A single resolved value — `WindowSurfaceColor` — drives the per-frame
clear. It is resolved in priority order each time `ComputedStyle` is
recomputed for the root node (Style plan §3.6 / Phase 2):

```
1. Inline Style on the root UIView (highest)
     └─ if `style().backgroundColor` is set, that wins.
2. Active custom Theme's surface color
     └─ if `application().theme() != nullptr`, look up the surface color
        in the variant matching the OS appearance bit
        (theme.light().surface / theme.dark().surface).
3. NativeTheme.colors.background  (default)
     └─ queried from the OS on window creation + on appearance change.
4. Hardcoded fallback
     └─ Color::White (Light) / Color::Black approximated for Dark.
        Only reached if NativeTheme is unavailable (e.g. headless test).
```

Same chain governs other theme-derived values that need to land on the
native surface: e.g. the window-level `setOpacity` interacts with the
chosen surface color the same way (alpha-premultiplied), but the
clear-color decision is the primary new contract here.

The `ThemeAppearance` bit (Light | Dark) is always sourced from
`NativeTheme.appearance`, regardless of which row of the priority chain
wins — that is the "follow OS dark mode" semantic. A custom theme that
does not want to follow the OS can override by calling
`application().setForcedAppearance(ThemeAppearance::Dark)`; the OS
observer then no longer drives appearance flips.

---

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Existing pieces (no change)

- `Native::ThemeDesc` (`wtk/include/omegaWTK/Native/NativeTheme.h`) —
  the data carrier: `appearance` + `Colors{accent, background,
  foreground, controlBackground, controlForeground, separator,
  selection}` + `Typography`. Reused as-is.
- `Native::queryCurrentTheme()` — the static fetch. Reused; GTK gap is
  filled as part of this plan's Tier 1.
- `Native::NativeThemeObserver::onThemeSet(ThemeDesc&)` — the observer
  interface. Reused; the platform plumbing that *fires* it is filled in
  per-platform in Tier 1.

### 4.2 New: `Application` ownership of `NativeTheme`

The `Application` (Style plan §3.8) gains a small ownership block:

```cpp
class Application {
public:
    // ... existing setTheme(ThemePtr) / themeVars() ...

    /// The most recently observed OS theme. Driven by the platform
    /// observer registered at Application construction; mutated only
    /// by the Application's own observer trampoline.
    const Native::ThemeDesc & nativeTheme() const;

    /// When true, app code does not want to follow OS appearance flips;
    /// the cascade uses application().forcedAppearance() in place of
    /// nativeTheme().appearance.
    void setForcedAppearance(Optional<Native::ThemeAppearance>);
    Optional<Native::ThemeAppearance> forcedAppearance() const;

    /// Resolved per the §3 priority chain. Read at clear-color setup
    /// time; the value is recomputed when any of {root style,
    /// active custom Theme, nativeTheme, forcedAppearance} changes.
    Composition::Color resolveWindowSurfaceColor(const AppWindow & win) const;
};
```

`Application` registers exactly one OS theme observer at construction.
On each `onThemeSet` callback, it (a) caches the new `ThemeDesc`, and
(b) marks every registered window's root node `DirtyBit::Style`,
forcing the resolver to re-derive `WindowSurfaceColor` and the rest of
the cascade. This is the same root-dirty propagation Style plan §3.8
uses for custom-theme swaps — the two flows converge.

### 4.3 New: the surface-color sink on `AppWindow`

```cpp
class AppWindow {
public:
    /// Set explicitly by the resolver after running the §3 priority
    /// chain. Sourced from app code only via inline Style or
    /// Application::setTheme.
    void setSurfaceColor(Composition::Color);
    Composition::Color surfaceColor() const;
};
```

`setSurfaceColor` writes through to the per-window `FrameBuilder` /
compositor binding so the next `beginFrame` issues the per-frame render
pass with the new `clearValue`. The actual translation happens in the
backend-specific `BackendRenderTargetContext` (the existing
per-window render-target machinery — see Panels-And-Window-Customization-Plan
Part C for the larger queue/context picture). The clear-color contract
is a one-field change to the existing `GERenderPassDescriptor` setup
inside the compositor's per-window frame open.

### 4.4 Flow per frame

1. **OS event** (mac: `viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance`, Win32:
   `WM_SETTINGCHANGE`/`WM_THEMECHANGED`, GTK:
   `notify::gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` on `GtkSettings`) →
   `Application`'s observer callback fires.
2. **Application caches** the new `ThemeDesc`, dirties root style on
   every registered window.
3. **Next frame, Phase 2 (Style)** — `StyleResolver::resolve(rootNode)`
   runs. Cascade reaches the surface-color rule, calls
   `application().resolveWindowSurfaceColor(win)`, writes the result
   into `win.setSurfaceColor(...)`.
4. **Next frame, Phase 4 (Paint)** — the compositor opens its render
   pass with the resolved color as the `clearValue`. Vulkan / D3D12 /
   Metal each see the same one `Color` value; the platform asymmetry is
   gone.

---

## 5. Per-platform realization

### 5.1 macOS — keep the outcome, change the mechanism

Today macOS gets a themed clear "for free" because `CAMetalLayer.opaque
= NO` lets the `NSWindow` background show through. Under this plan:

- `CAMetalLayer.opaque = YES`. The window content is whatever we
  rendered; the native backing color is no longer relied on.
- The Metal render pass `clearColor` is `application().resolveWindowSurfaceColor(win)`.
- `viewDidChangeEffectiveAppearance` on the content view fires the
  observer (already wired by `queryCurrentTheme()`'s test surface
  — verify).

Visual outcome is unchanged in default usage; the difference is that
macOS now obeys the same priority chain as the other platforms and a
custom `Theme` color actually wins (today it does not — the native
background overpaints transparent regions).

### 5.2 Windows — pull the swapchain clear color from `NativeTheme`

- D3D12 render pass clears to `application().resolveWindowSurfaceColor(win)`
  instead of whatever the engine's hardcoded default is.
- Observer: subscribe to `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` with `lParam` pointing at
  `"ImmersiveColorSet"` (the dark-mode flip), and `WM_THEMECHANGED` for
  classic-theme changes. Each fires `Application`'s observer trampoline
  with a fresh `queryCurrentTheme()` result.
- Optional polish: also call
  `DwmSetWindowAttribute(hwnd, DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE, …)` so
  the title bar matches the resolved appearance (orthogonal to the
  content clear color but part of the same "follow OS dark mode"
  contract). Note this is independent of the chrome-customization in
  [Panels-And-Window-Customization-Plan.md](Panels-And-Window-Customization-Plan.md);
  it applies under `WindowChrome::Native`.

### 5.3 GTK + Vulkan — fill the query gap, then clear to that color

This is the platform where the user-visible bug bites hardest today.
Two pieces:

**5.3.1 — Fill the GTK `queryCurrentTheme` gap.** The Native-API
proposal Current State table still lists GTK NativeTheme as "missing"
even though the completion-status header marks §2.5 Done — verify and
fill if absent. Source the data from:

- `appearance`: `gtk_settings_get_default()` →
  `gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` (bool). On GNOME the
  `org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme` GSettings key is the
  modern source; XSetting `Net/ThemeName` is the legacy fallback.
- `colors.background` / `foreground` / `accent`: pull from
  `GtkStyleContext` against the toplevel window's style class. The
  GTK CSS engine resolves `theme_bg_color`, `theme_fg_color`, and
  `theme_selected_bg_color` (accent) to concrete RGBA via
  `gtk_style_context_lookup_color(ctx, "theme_bg_color", &rgba)`.
- `colors.controlBackground` / `controlForeground`: same lookup against
  a temporary `GTK_STYLE_CLASS_BUTTON` context.

Observer: connect to
`g_signal_connect(settings, "notify::gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme", …)`
and `"notify::gtk-theme-name"`. Both re-query the theme and emit
`NativeThemeObserver::onThemeSet`.

**5.3.2 — Wire `NativeTheme.colors.background` into the Vulkan
clear.** This is the actual user-visible fix:

- `GEVulkanCommandQueue` / `GEVulkanCommandBuffer::startRenderPass`
  already takes a `VkClearValue` from the `GERenderPassDescriptor`. The
  WTK compositor sets that descriptor each frame at
  `FrameBuilder::beginFrame`. Today its `clearValue` is hardcoded /
  derived from the root `Style`'s background.
- Under this plan the compositor's per-window frame open reads
  `appWindow.surfaceColor()` (the resolved §3 result) and writes it as
  the `clearValue`. The Style resolver populated that field during
  Phase 2 of the same frame's tick.

No GTK-side change is needed for the clear itself — the GTK window
background isn't competing with Vulkan when the cleared color *is* the
GTK theme background. The "GTK theme inherited" outcome falls out of
the priority chain naturally.

---

## 6. Custom-theme integration with the Style plan

The Style plan §3.8 specifies:

```cpp
class Application {
public:
    void              setTheme(ThemePtr);
    ThemePtr          theme() const;
    const ThemeVars & themeVars() const;
};
```

This plan extends that surface without changing it:

- A `Theme` is a typed bundle of `ThemeVars` plus an explicit `surface`
  color. The Style plan's existing `ThemeVars` map carries the rest
  (`accent`, `foreground`, control colors, ...).
- A `Theme` may carry **light** and **dark** variants. The active
  variant is picked by `application().forcedAppearance().value_or(
  application().nativeTheme().appearance)`. This is the rule that lets
  custom themes "ignore" `NativeTheme` while still tracking OS dark
  mode.
- `setTheme(nullptr)` reverts to the native-theme default — the priority
  chain falls through to row 3.
- `StyleSheet`s author themed widget visuals through `StyleValue::Var("accent")`
  / `StyleValue::Var("surface")` etc., exactly as the Style plan §3.8
  already specifies. The new bits — `surface` color and
  light/dark-variant selection — slot into the same `ThemeVars`
  resolution path; no new resolver mechanism is required.

In short: this plan adds the **default source** for the theme variables
(the OS) and the **policy** for how a custom theme interacts with that
default (override the colors, inherit the appearance bit). The
resolver, the cascade rules, and the property-to-value plumbing are
already specified in the Style plan.

---

## 7. Migration tiers

### Tier 1 — `NativeTheme` query parity + the observer wiring

- Fill the GTK `queryCurrentTheme()` gap (§5.3.1) if not present.
- Implement the per-platform observer plumbing so
  `NativeThemeObserver::onThemeSet` fires on OS appearance change on
  all three platforms.
- Add `Application::nativeTheme()` getter (returns the cached
  `ThemeDesc`) and the observer trampoline that updates it.
- No clear-color change yet — this tier is observational only.

**Risk:** Low. Pure native plumbing; no engine behavior change.

**Files touched:** `wtk/src/Native/gtk/GTKTheme.cpp` (new or extend),
`wtk/src/Native/win/WinTheme.cpp` (extend observer registration),
`wtk/src/Native/macos/CocoaTheme.mm` (extend observer registration),
`wtk/include/omegaWTK/UI/Application.h`,
`wtk/src/UI/Application.cpp`.

### Tier 2 — surface-color sink + priority chain

- Add `AppWindow::setSurfaceColor` / `surfaceColor` + the compositor
  wiring that consumes it for the per-frame `clearValue`.
- Implement `Application::resolveWindowSurfaceColor(win)` per the §3
  priority chain (rows 1, 3, 4 — row 2 lands in Tier 3).
- Hook the resolver: after Phase 2 (Style) runs for the root, the
  resolver calls `setSurfaceColor` on the owning `AppWindow`.
- On macOS, flip `CAMetalLayer.opaque` to `YES` and start clearing
  explicitly to the resolved color. Verify the visual outcome matches
  pre-change behavior in default usage.

**Risk:** Low on Vulkan / D3D12 (one field change in the per-frame
descriptor); Medium on macOS (the `opaque` flip changes layer
composition and could surface unexpected interactions with window
chrome, especially under `WindowChrome::Custom`/`CustomWithNativeControls`
from the Panels plan — verify with the BasicAppTest first, then any
panel-using test once Panels Part A lands).

**Files touched:** `wtk/include/omegaWTK/UI/AppWindow.h`,
`wtk/src/UI/AppWindow.cpp`, `wtk/src/UI/FrameBuilder.cpp`,
`wtk/src/Composition/backend/RenderTarget.h`,
`wtk/src/Native/macos/CocoaAppWindow.mm` (the `.opaque = YES` flip),
the per-backend visual-tree builders.

### Tier 3 — custom theme override + appearance forcing

- Land row 2 of the §3 priority chain: if `application().theme() !=
  nullptr`, the custom theme's `surface` color (in the variant matching
  the active appearance) overrides `NativeTheme.colors.background`.
- Add `setForcedAppearance` + `forcedAppearance` and route them through
  the variant-pick.
- Custom `Theme` data type: a `ThemeVars` for each variant, an
  explicit `Composition::Color surface` per variant, and a name. Lives
  next to `ThemeVars` from the Style plan §3.8.
- A custom theme's variant flip on OS appearance change goes through
  the same root-dirty path as Tier 1 — no new propagation mechanism.

**Risk:** Low. Pure data-flow extension to the Application-level theme
machinery already proposed by the Style plan.

**Files touched:** `wtk/include/omegaWTK/UI/Application.h`,
`wtk/src/UI/Application.cpp`, `wtk/include/omegaWTK/UI/Theme.h` (new),
`wtk/src/UI/StyleResolver.cpp` (the cascade source for `surface`).

### Tier 4 — UA stylesheet uses `NativeTheme` defaults

Once the Style plan's user-agent stylesheet (Tier 3 of that plan)
lands, its `Button`/`Label`/`Icon` default styles bind their text color
to `var(--foreground)`, their control fills to `var(--control-background)`,
etc. — all of which resolve from the `ThemeVars` populated either by
the active custom `Theme` or by the cached `NativeTheme`. Widgets stop
hardcoding visual defaults; everything tracks the OS in default
configuration and the app theme in opted-in configuration.

This is more of a consequence than a step — it's the Style plan's Tier
3 with this plan as the data source. No new code lives here.

---

## 8. Open questions

1. **One global `NativeTheme` vs. per-window `NativeTheme`.** On
   macOS, the effective appearance can vary per-window (a window with
   `NSAppearance.appearanceNamed:NSAppearanceNameAqua` overrides the
   system default). On Win32, dark-mode hint via DWM is per-window
   too. On GTK, the theme is desktop-wide. Recommendation: keep
   `Application::nativeTheme()` as the *system* default, add an
   optional `AppWindow::nativeTheme()` override that defaults to
   `application().nativeTheme()` but can be replaced by app code to
   force one window into a specific appearance. Defer until somebody
   actually asks for per-window appearance.
2. **`Theme` data model.** This plan refers to a custom `Theme` with
   light/dark variants, but the data model isn't fully spelled out
   here — does it own the `ThemeVars` outright, or is it a
   variant-selector that points at one of two `ThemeVars`? Probably
   the latter (less duplication when only the accent and surface
   differ between variants). Worth confirming when the Style plan
   moves Tier 3.
3. **CAMetalLayer `opaque = YES` regressions.** Flipping to opaque
   changes layer composition on macOS in ways that interact with
   window chrome corner rounding and the title-bar accessory area.
   Verify with `WindowChrome::CustomWithNativeControls` once Panels
   Part B lands — the traffic-light region might still expect a
   transparent backing. If it does, the `opaque` flip is conditional
   on `WindowChrome::Native` and falls back to the current transparent
   path under Custom modes. (Custom modes can clear to the resolved
   color regardless; only the *layer* opacity is affected.)
4. **Disabling OS-appearance follow per-app.** Some apps want to ship
   in a fixed appearance regardless of OS. `setForcedAppearance` covers
   the case where the app *picks* Light or Dark globally. The narrower
   case — "always Light, even on Dark OS, but still apply the custom
   theme's Light variant" — is also covered by
   `setForcedAppearance(Light)`. Confirm this is sufficient before
   adding a third axis.
5. **Linux desktop session detection beyond GTK.** Wayland sessions
   under GNOME read the color-scheme key the same way; KDE Plasma uses
   `kdeglobals` `ColorScheme` instead, and there is no GTK-side signal
   for that change. Out of scope for Tier 1 (we ride GTK's view of the
   world); flag for follow-up if KDE-host coverage becomes a
   requirement.
6. **Headless / test mode.** `queryCurrentTheme()` on a headless CI
   runner — what does it return? Currently undefined per
   `NativeTheme.h`. Recommendation: `ThemeDesc{}` defaulted values
   (Light appearance, white background) and `nativeTheme()` returns
   that. Style resolver falls through to row 4 (hardcoded) on the
   same data, so behavior is consistent.

---

## 9. Relationship to existing plans

- **[Native-API-Completion-Proposal.md](Native-API-Completion-Proposal.md) §2.5** — the existing
  `NativeTheme.h` query API is the input to this plan. §2.5 will gain
  a forward-pointer note that the observer-wiring + application-side
  story lives here. Also: verify the GTK gap (§5.3.1) is real — the
  Current State table and completion-status header disagree.
- **[Style-StyleSheet-Refactor-Plan.md](Style-StyleSheet-Refactor-Plan.md) §3.8** — owns
  `Application::setTheme` and the `ThemeVars` cascade. This plan adds
  the *default source* for those variables (the OS) and the *custom
  override policy*. The Style plan's §3.8 gains a forward-pointer
  note. The cascade rules, property-to-value plumbing, and dirty-bit
  propagation are unchanged.
- **[Panels-And-Window-Customization-Plan.md](Panels-And-Window-Customization-Plan.md)** —
  Part B (`WindowChrome`) interacts with this plan in two places:
  (a) the title-bar caption color under `Custom` should track
  `NativeTheme.appearance` so the app-drawn caption matches the OS
  chrome the user expects; (b) the `CAMetalLayer.opaque` flip in
  Tier 2 §5.1 needs verification against the custom-chrome path
  (Open Q3). The `AppPanel` surface color follows the same priority
  chain as `AppWindow` — Application-scoped resolution, panel-owned
  sink — when the Panels plan lands.
- **[Widget-View-Paint-Lifecycle-Plan.md](Widget-View-Paint-Lifecycle-Plan.md)** —
  Phase 2 (Style) is the resolver site for `WindowSurfaceColor`;
  Phase 4 (Paint) is where the compositor consumes
  `appWindow.surfaceColor()` into the clear value. The phase guard
  enforces that no other site mutates the surface color mid-frame.
- **[Animation-Scheduler-Plan.md](Animation-Scheduler-Plan.md)** —
  Theme changes (OS or custom) could be animated as a cross-fade
  between resolved surface colors. Out of scope for this plan;
  `setSurfaceColor` is a hard write today. If theme transitions
  become a feature, the standard Style plan `Transition` record on
  `Property::Surface` (Style §3.5) hands off to the scheduler via the
  same `transition(...)` hook — no new mechanism required.

---

## 10. Honest uncertainty

~~I have not verified that GTK + Vulkan today literally renders pitch
black with no theme inheritance — the user reported it but I have not
isolated the swapchain `clearValue` in the WTK Vulkan render-target
context to confirm.~~ **Verified 2026-06-02.** The full chain is:
`Compositor::renderCompositeFrame` (`wtk/src/Composition/Compositor.cpp:293-312`)
initialises `clearR=clearG=clearB=clearA=0`, scans `frame->slices` for
the first slice with any RGBA component `> 0`, and adopts that slice's
`background` if it finds one. With no explicit root background (the
BasicAppTest case), every slice carries `(0,0,0,0)`, the loop never
fires, and `targetContext->beginFrame(0,0,0,0)` calls into
`FrameRenderPass::begin` (`wtk/src/Composition/backend/RenderPass.cpp:64-78`),
which builds a `GERenderPassDescriptor::ColorAttachment::Clear` with
clear color `(0,0,0,0)`. The Vulkan backend
(`GEVulkanCommandBuffer::startRenderPass` in
`gte/src/vulkan/GEVulkanCommandQueue.cpp:750-770`) copies that
straight into `VkClearValue.color.float32[0..3]`. The RGBA swapchain
treats `(0,0,0,0)` as opaque black. **That's the pitch black the user
sees, verbatim.** Tier 2 replaces that call site with
`targetContext->beginFrame(surface.r, surface.g, surface.b,
surface.a)` where `surface = application().resolveWindowSurfaceColor(win)`,
and the "first non-zero slice wins" heuristic in
`renderCompositeFrame` (which has its own latent fragility — a
non-root slice with a translucent background can steal the
whole-window clear) is deleted alongside.

I have assumed `CAMetalLayer.opaque` is `NO` today on the macOS
backend, which is what gives the implicit OS-themed clear. The
secondary fingerprints in the tree are consistent with that —
`wtk/src/Native/macos/CocoaItem.mm:22-24` (and the matching header at
`CocoaItem.h:119-121`) explicitly set `layer.backgroundColor` to a
`(0,0,0,0)` CGColor on the *root content view's* `CALayer`, which is
exactly what's needed for the metal layer above it to composite over
the `NSWindow` background. But I have NOT located the
`CAMetalLayer.opaque` assignment itself; verify on the macOS side
before flipping it in Tier 2. If `.opaque` is already `YES` and the
mac visual is being produced by an explicit `[NSColor
windowBackgroundColor]`-sourced `clearColor` somewhere, §5.1 simplifies
to "route the existing NSColor source through
`Application::resolveWindowSurfaceColor` instead of looking up
`NSColor` directly."

I have assumed the Application is the right owner for the OS theme
observer, mirroring the Style plan §6 Q1 resolution
("`Application`-scoped style sheets"). If theming needs to vary per
window (Open Q1) before Tier 1 ships, the observer moves to
`AppWindow` and the per-app cached `ThemeDesc` becomes a per-window
cached `ThemeDesc`. The §3 priority chain is unchanged; only the
ownership level shifts.

I have assumed that on Windows the existing D3D12 swapchain creation
path takes a clear color from a per-window context (it does — see
Panels plan Part C's discussion of `BackendRenderTargetContext`). If
the current code hardcodes the clear color at swapchain-creation time
rather than per-frame, Tier 2's "set it from the resolver each frame"
contract requires moving that source to the per-frame render-pass
descriptor first. Likely already correct on Vulkan + Metal; verify on
D3D12.
